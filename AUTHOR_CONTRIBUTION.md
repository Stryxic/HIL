# Author Contribution Statement

This work integrates established results from information theory, geometry, and measurement science into a deterministic, covariant framework for the analysis of structured information.

The author’s sole original contribution is the introduction and formalization of **informational mass** within the HIL framework.

Informational mass is defined as a covariant, noise-aware functional that measures the amount of geometric structure resolved above an instrument’s absolute resolution threshold. It explicitly distinguishes globally consolidated structure from local, non-invariant resolvability and elevates instrumental resolution limits to the status of a hard variant rather than an implicit assumption.

No new physical principles, learning mechanisms, semantic models, or optimization criteria are introduced. All other components of HIL are consistent with, and derived from, prior theoretical foundations. The contribution lies in the precise synthesis, naming, and formal placement of informational mass as a first-class diagnostic quantity governing the consolidation of information over time.
