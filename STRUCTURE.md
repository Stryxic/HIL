## Epistemic Rationale for Repository Organisation

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains **why this repository is structured as it is**.

The organisation reflects the epistemic commitments of the thesis rather than
conventional software engineering practice. It is intended to help examiners,
reviewers, and future readers understand how theory, code, evidence, and
documentation relate, and why certain expected artefacts (e.g. production
tooling) are intentionally absent.

This repository should be read as a **scholarly archive and laboratory record**,
not as an evolving software project.

---

## Design Principle: Co-equal Artefacts

A central claim of the thesis is that **epistemic stability arises from structured
relationships, not from any single representation**.

Accordingly, this repository treats the following as *co-equal*:

- formal theory,
- computational implementation,
- empirical traces,
- diagrams and visualisations,
- and governance documentation.

No single directory is “primary”; meaning emerges from their alignment.

## High-Level Structure

```
/
├── thesis/
├── theory/
├── code/
├── traces/
├── diagrams/
├── reproducibility/
├── federation/
└── documentation files (README, CHARTER, ROADMAP, etc.)
```

Each component serves a distinct epistemic role.

## Thesis Directory

**`thesis/`**

Contains the doctoral manuscript and appendices in their submitted form.

This material is the **authoritative statement of claims, definitions, and
conclusions**. All other artefacts in the repository exist to support inspection
of those claims, not to supersede them.

Nothing in this directory is generated by code in this repository.

---

## Theory Directory

**`theory/`**

Contains human-readable formal documents describing:

- Knowledge–Information Theory (K–IT),
- the Hilbert Epistemic Field (HEF),
- epistemic regimes and stability concepts.

These documents are intentionally separate from code in order to:

- preserve conceptual clarity,
- prevent theory from being inferred solely from implementation details,
- and allow future theoretical development without coupling to software.

Mathematical precision is prioritised over executable form.

---

## Code Directory

**`code/`**

Contains a **reference implementation** of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL).

The implementation is intentionally:
- modular,
- conservative,
- readable,
- and minimally optimised.

Its purpose is to demonstrate that the theoretical constructs of the thesis
are computable and inspectable—not to provide a production-ready system.

Design choices favour traceability and transparency over efficiency or scale.

---

## Traces Directory

**`traces/`**

Contains **frozen empirical artefacts** produced during analysis runs.

Each trace includes:
- configuration manifests,
- intermediate outputs,
- stability and regime diagnostics,
- and rendered figures.

These traces function as **evidence**, not as benchmarks.

They allow readers to inspect the behaviour of the system without rerunning
full pipelines, which may be computationally expensive or nondeterministic.

---

## Diagrams Directory

**`diagrams/`**

Contains conceptual and explanatory visualisations, including:

- field representations,
- molecule and compound structures,
- regime landscapes,
- and governance sketches.

These diagrams are not derived automatically from code.
They are explanatory tools intended to support human understanding.

---

## Reproducibility Directory

**`reproducibility/`**

Documents the conditions under which results were generated and preserved.

Reproducibility here is defined as:
- epistemic reproducibility (structural patterns recur),
- not necessarily bitwise determinism.

This distinction is made explicit to avoid overclaiming reproducibility in
high-dimensional or stochastic settings.

---

## Federation Directory

**`federation/`**

Contains **conceptual documents only**.

These describe potential future directions for:
- distributed deployment,
- governance,
- and custodial models.

No operational federation is implemented here.

Their inclusion reflects theoretical implications of the work, not claims of
completed engineering.

---

## Documentation Files at Repository Root

Files such as:

- `README.md`
- `CHARTER.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `CITATION.cff`
- `STRUCTURE.md`

define orientation, scope, closure, and citation.

They are part of the scholarly apparatus and should be read as such.

---

## Why This Is Not a Conventional Software Repository

Several elements common to software projects are intentionally absent:

- performance benchmarks,
- CI/CD pipelines,
- feature roadmaps,
- issue trackers,
- and user-facing documentation.

Including these would misrepresent the nature of the work and obscure its
primary function as a research artefact.

The absence of such elements should not be interpreted as incompleteness.

---

## Intentional Boundaries

This repository does **not** claim to:

- detect truth or falsity,
- attribute intent,
- operate at planetary scale,
- or function as a deployed system.

Those questions are discussed theoretically in the thesis but are not
operationalised here.

---

## Closing Statement

The structure of this repository is an expression of the thesis itself.

It embodies the claim that epistemic reliability emerges from coherent
relationships among representations—formal, computational, and empirical.

This repository is therefore complete **by design**, not by exhaustion.
