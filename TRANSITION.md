# TRANSITION.md  
## From Doctoral Artefact to Continuing HIL Development

---

## Purpose of This Document

This file records the **explicit transition point** at which the *Hilbert Information Lab (HIL)* moves from a **frozen doctoral artefact** to an **actively continued research system**.

Its purpose is to:
- preserve the integrity of the PhD submission,
- make clear what is allowed to change going forward,
- and prevent ambiguity about the status of future work.

This document is descriptive, not normative.

## Status of the Doctoral Artefact

The PhD thesis *“Hilbert Epistemic Fields and Informational Stability”* and the state of this repository **at the point of doctoral submission** together constitute a **sealed scholarly record**.

- The thesis remains the authoritative source of all theoretical claims.
- The repository at submission time is the canonical supplementary artefact.
- That state is preserved for citation, examination, and historical reference.

No future change redefines or retroactively alters the doctoral work.

---

## Transition Boundary

**Transition declared on:**  
01-01-2026

**Freeze commit / tag:**  
v0.1-phd

All commits **after this boundary** represent **continued development of HIL** as a living research system and are **part of the doctoral submission** until submission date, at which point they are **not part of the doctoral submission**.

---

## What Changes After This Point

From this transition onward:

- HIL is treated as an **ongoing research codebase**, not only as a witness artefact.
- Internal structure, abstractions, and implementation details may evolve.
- New capabilities (e.g. hosting, federation experiments, system integration) may be explored.
- Performance, ergonomics, and long-running operation may be addressed.

These changes are **forward-looking** and do not reinterpret the thesis.

---

## What Remains Invariant

Despite continued development, the following commitments remain intact:

- **Theory-first:** formal theory precedes and constrains implementation.
- **Diagnostic, not prescriptive:** HIL characterises informational structure; it does not decide truth, belief, or action.
- **No epistemic authority:** outputs remain descriptive artefacts, not verdicts.
- **No hidden optimisation objective:** stability and related quantities are not control signals.
- **Orthogonality to coercive governance:** economic, political, or enforcement power does not confer epistemic authority.

These invariants persist unless explicitly and publicly revised in future research documents.

---

## Relationship to Future Work

All post-transition development should be understood as:

- **continuation**, not correction, of the doctoral work;
- **extension**, not reinterpretation, of the original theory;
- **experimental**, where federation, hosting, or interaction patterns are involved.

Future publications, repositories, or systems must cite the PhD thesis directly for theoretical claims and must not attribute new claims retroactively to the doctoral artefact.

---

## Reading Guidance

Readers encountering commits after the transition boundary should assume:

- the work reflects active research and exploration,
- design decisions may change,
- and no claim of completeness or finality is implied.

For authoritative statements of the original theory and evidence, consult:
- the PhD thesis,
- the repository state at the freeze commit,
- and the governance documents (`CHARTER.md`, `NON_CLAIMS.md`).

---

## Final Statement

This transition is declared to enable **progress without ambiguity**.

The doctoral work remains complete.  
HIL continues.
