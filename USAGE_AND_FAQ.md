# Usage & FAQ (Interpretive Guide)

**Purpose:**  
This document answers common questions about how the *Hilbert Epistemic Fields and Informational Stability* work is typically used, read, and misused. It is provided as an interpretive aid for readers, reviewers, and downstream researchers.

It does **not** introduce new theory, define requirements, or prescribe applications. If there is any conflict between this document and the thesis or authoritative repository documents, the thesis and those documents take precedence.

## Canonical status

- The **doctoral thesis** and the repository contents at the time of submission constitute the canonical artefact.
- This repository should be treated as **non-canonical until a formal tagged release is made**.
- This file is **explicitly non-canonical** and may be revised or removed without affecting the PhD work.

## Typical usage (what this work *is* used for)

### How is this work typically used?

In practice, the work is used as:
- a **formal lens** for reasoning about informational structure,
- a **diagnostic framework** for analysing stability and transformation of information,
- a **conceptual bridge** between formal epistemology, geometry, and information theory,
- a **reference object** for downstream, optional research.

It is commonly read:
- analytically (to understand the formal structure),
- comparatively (alongside other epistemic or geometric frameworks),
- or diagnostically (to reason about informational configurations without prescribing outcomes).

### What kind of questions does it help answer?

The framework is suited to questions such as:
- *What structural relationships exist between informational states?*
- *How do certain informational configurations persist or change under transformation?*
- *What does stability mean when stripped of correctness or truth claims?*

It is **not** suited to answering questions about what should be believed, decided, or enforced.

## What this work is not used for

### Is this a decision-making system?
No. The framework does not make decisions, recommendations, or judgments.

### Does it determine truth, correctness, or belief quality?
No. Stability and structure are not endorsements of truth or validity.

### Is this an alignment, safety, or governance framework?
No. The work does not define objectives, incentives, enforcement mechanisms, or guarantees.

### Is it a cognitive or agent-based model?
No. The theory does not model agents, minds, beliefs, or intentions.

### Is it a platform, protocol, or infrastructure proposal?
No. There is no global system, registry, or standard implied or proposed.

---

## Common misunderstandings

### “Stability means correctness or consensus”
Stability is a **structural property**, not an epistemic or normative one. Stable configurations may still be false, misleading, or undesirable.

### “The implementation defines the theory”
The Hilbert Information Lab (HIL) is a **witness implementation**. It illustrates aspects of the theory but does not define or constrain it.

### “Missing features indicate incompleteness”
The absence of agents, optimisation, enforcement, or governance mechanisms is **intentional** and load-bearing.

---

## Using the code (HIL)

### What is the code for?
The reference implementation exists to:
- make abstract structures concrete,
- enable reproducible experiments,
- and provide a shared language for discussion.

### What should the code *not* be used for?
- As a production system  
- As an authoritative reference  
- As an optimisation or evaluation engine  

Any such use is downstream and external to the thesis.

---

## Federation and scale

### Does this work support federation?
It supports **replication and coexistence**, not mandatory coordination.

### Is there a central or global model?
No. Centralisation contradicts the stated scale assumptions.

### Can instances disagree?
Yes. Disagreement and divergence are compatible with the framework.

---

## Extending the work responsibly

### Can I build on this thesis?
Yes, provided that:
- the thesis is cited explicitly,
- new work is clearly marked as downstream,
- no new claims are attributed retroactively.

### Can I add agents, optimisation, or governance?
Only as **external extensions**, with their own theoretical justification. They are not implied by the thesis.

## How to cite and interpret this repository

- Cite the **thesis** for theoretical claims.
- Treat the repository as a **supporting artefact**, not an authority.
- Use this FAQ as a guide to scope, not as a source of claims.

---

## If you are unsure

When in doubt:
- assume the interpretation is **narrower**, not broader;
- prefer description over prescription;
- and consult the thesis, CHARTER.md, and NON_CLAIMS.md.
