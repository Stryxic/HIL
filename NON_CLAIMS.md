## Explicit Non-Claims and Scope Limits

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists **explicit non-claims** associated with the Hilbert Epistemic
Field framework and the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL) reference implementation
contained in this repository.

Its purpose is to prevent:
- overinterpretation,
- inappropriate application,
- and retroactive inflation of claims.

This document should be read as a companion to `CHARTER.md`, focusing specifically
on **what is not asserted** by the thesis or its supplementary artefacts.

## Epistemic Non-Claims

This work does **not** claim to:

- determine objective truth or falsity of statements,
- adjudicate between competing beliefs or ideologies,
- infer intent, motivation, or coordination strategy of actors,
- identify individual agents responsible for disinformation,
- provide ground truth labels for content.

The framework operates on **structural properties of informational systems**, not
on semantic correctness or belief evaluation.

---

## Methodological Non-Claims

This work does **not** claim:

- optimality of the proposed operators or metrics,
- completeness of the epistemic field representation,
- uniqueness of entropy, coherence, or stability formulations,
- that alternative mathematical formalisms would fail,
- that results are invariant to all parameter choices.

The methods presented are **sufficient to demonstrate the thesis claims**, not
asserted to be the only or best possible methods.

---

## Empirical Non-Claims

The empirical results included in this repository do **not** claim:

- exhaustive coverage of all disinformation phenomena,
- statistical generalisation to all corpora or domains,
- predictive accuracy in a supervised learning sense,
- real-time detection guarantees,
- causal attribution of observed instability patterns.

Empirical traces are illustrative and evidential, not benchmark results.

---

## Computational Non-Claims

This repository does **not** claim:

- production readiness,
- scalability to planetary-scale data,
- computational efficiency,
- robustness to adversarial optimisation,
- suitability for safety-critical or enforcement contexts.

Performance characteristics are incidental to the research goals.

---

## Governance and Deployment Non-Claims

This work does **not** claim to provide:

- a ready-to-deploy governance framework,
- a complete federation protocol,
- a platform for monitoring populations,
- a mechanism for automated intervention or moderation,
- an authority structure for epistemic control.

Any future deployment requires independent design, oversight, and accountability.

---

## Ethical and Normative Non-Claims

The thesis and repository do **not** claim:

- moral authority over belief systems,
- normative prescriptions for acceptable speech,
- justification for censorship or coercion,
- replacement of democratic or deliberative processes.

The framework is diagnostic, not normative or prescriptive.

---

## Relationship to External Systems

This work does **not** assert:

- compatibility with all legal or regulatory regimes,
- fitness for use in adversarial geopolitical contexts,
- alignment with commercial surveillance models,
- inevitability of adoption or impact.

Such questions lie outside the scope of the doctoral research.

---

## Final Statement

The explicit purpose of these non-claims is not to diminish the contribution of
the work, but to **locate it precisely**.

The thesis advances a formal, computational approach to understanding epistemic
stability and instability. It does not attempt to resolve all questions that such
an approach raises.

Any use that relies on claims not made here extends beyond the scope of this
research and should be evaluated independently.
