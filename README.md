# Hilbert Information Lab (HIL): PhD Supplementary Repository

This repository is the **canonical supplementary artefact** accompanying the PhD thesis  
**“Detecting Disinformation Campaigns in Social Media.”**

It contains the final and authoritative materials supporting the thesis, including:

- the complete doctoral manuscript and appendices,
- formal theoretical definitions and mathematical exposition (Knowledge–Information Theory, Hilbert Epistemic Fields),
- a reference implementation of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL),
- diagrams documenting epistemic structure and informational flow,
- and curated empirical traces demonstrating informational regimes and stability behaviour.

This repository is intended to function as a **scholarly record**, not as a production software project, platform, or commercial system. Its purpose is to make the intellectual structure, computational realisation, and empirical grounding of the thesis transparent, inspectable, and citable.

## Scope and Intent

The materials in this repository represent a **frozen snapshot** of the work as submitted for doctoral examination. They are organised to preserve parity between theory, code, documentation, diagrams, and empirical traces.

This repository:

- **is** a reference implementation and evidential archive,
- **is** designed for academic inspection and reproducibility,
- **is not** a platform, service, or operational deployment,
- **is not** optimised for performance, scalability, or production use,
- **is not** a complete implementation of future federated, institutional, or governance systems.

Any subsequent development, operationalisation, or extension of the work occurs in **separate, downstream repositories** and should not be conflated with the doctoral artefact presented here.

## Canonical Status, Releases, and Versioning

- The **doctoral thesis manuscript** and the repository contents at the time of submission together constitute the **canonical PhD artefact**.
- Until a **formal, tagged release** is made, this repository should be treated as **non-canonical** for citation and interpretive purposes.
- Commits after submission are limited to clerical corrections, formatting, or explicitly labelled interpretive aids. They do **not** modify the meaning, scope, or claims of the doctoral work.

If any conflict arises between files, the thesis manuscript and the authoritative governance documents take precedence.

---

## Relationship to the Thesis

The repository is structured to map directly onto the thesis:

- theoretical constructs correspond to formal definitions and arguments in the manuscript,
- code modules witness specific mathematical and epistemic claims,
- empirical traces correspond to figures, analyses, and stability discussions in the results chapters.

A detailed cross-reference between thesis sections and repository artefacts is provided in `thesis/crosswalk.md` to support examination, auditability, and scholarly reuse.

## Interpretive Aids (Non-Canonical)

The following documents are provided to reduce misinterpretation and overreach. They are **explicitly non-canonical** and do not extend or modify the thesis:

- `CHARTER.md` — epistemic and governance boundaries  
- `NON_CLAIMS.md` — explicit statements of what the work does *not* assert  
- `COMPANION_INTERPRETATION_NOTE.md` — common misreadings and clarifications  
- `USAGE_AND_FAQ.md` — typical usage patterns and scope-limiting guidance  

These files are intended as interpretive firebreaks, not as sources of new claims.

## Use of AI-Assisted Tools (Disclosure)

Large language models, including ChatGPT, were used **selectively and instrumentally** during the research process.

Their role was limited to:
- accelerating the **ablation** of existing arguments,
- assisting in the **connection and comparison** of researcher-authored ideas,
- supporting **stress-testing and clarification** of formal reasoning.

They were **not used to generate novel theoretical content, mathematical claims, or empirical results**. All core concepts, definitions, proofs, interpretations, and conclusions are the intellectual work of the author.

In this sense, AI tools functioned analogously to:
- an interactive notebook,
- a structured dialogue partner,
- or an accelerated form of conceptual peer interrogation,

rather than as a source of original scholarship.

This disclosure is made in the interest of transparency and methodological clarity.

## Citation

The **thesis** should be cited for all theoretical and interpretive claims.  
This repository should be cited as a **supplementary artefact** supporting the thesis.

Later versions, forks, or derivative projects are not part of the doctoral submission unless explicitly stated.
