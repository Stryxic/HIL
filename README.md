# Hilbert Information Lab (HIL): PhD Supplementary Repository

This repository is the **canonical supplementary artefact** accompanying the PhD thesis  
**“Hilbert Epistemic Fields and Informational Stability”**.

It contains the final and authoritative materials supporting the thesis, including:

- the complete doctoral manuscript and appendices,
- formal theoretical definitions and mathematical exposition,
- a reference implementation of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL),
- diagrams documenting system structure and epistemic flow,
- and empirical traces demonstrating informational regimes and stability behaviour.

This repository is intended to function as a **scholarly record**, not as a production software project or commercial system. Its purpose is to make the intellectual structure, computational realisation, and empirical grounding of the thesis transparent, inspectable, and citable.

## Scope and Intent

The materials in this repository represent a **frozen snapshot** of the work as submitted for doctoral examination. They are organised to reflect parity between theory, code, documentation, diagrams, and empirical traces.

This repository:

- **is** a reference implementation and evidential archive,
- **is** designed for academic inspection and reproducibility,
- **is not** a platform, service, or production deployment,
- **is not** optimised for performance, scalability, or operational use,
- **is not** a complete implementation of future federated or institutional systems.

Any subsequent development, operationalisation, or extension of the work will occur in separate repositories and should not be conflated with the doctoral artefact presented here.

---

## Relationship to the Thesis

The repository is structured to map directly onto the thesis:

- theoretical constructs correspond to formal definitions in the manuscript,
- code modules operationalise specific mathematical and epistemic claims,
- empirical traces correspond to figures and analyses in the results chapters.

A detailed cross-reference between thesis sections and repository contents is provided to support examination and scholarly reuse.

## Use of AI-Assisted Tools (Disclosure)

Large language models, including ChatGPT, were used **selectively and instrumentally** during the research process.

Their role was limited to:
- accelerating the **ablation** of existing arguments,
- assisting in the **connection and comparison** of researcher-authored ideas,
- supporting **stress-testing and clarification** of formal reasoning.

They were **not used to generate novel theoretical content, mathematical claims, or empirical results**. All core concepts, definitions, proofs, interpretations, and conclusions are the intellectual work of the author.

In this sense, AI tools functioned analogously to:
- an interactive notebook,
- a structured dialogue partner,
- or an accelerated form of conceptual peer review,

rather than as a source of original scholarship.

This disclosure is made in the interest of transparency and methodological clarity.

## Citation and Versioning

This repository represents the definitive PhD version of the work and should be cited accordingly. A citation file is provided for reference.

Later versions or derivative projects should not be treated as part of the doctoral submission unless explicitly stated.
