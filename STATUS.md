# Repository Status — v0.1 (Pre-Submission)

## Current Status

This repository is a **pre-submission working repository (v0.1)** associated with an ongoing doctoral project.

It is **not canonical**, **not frozen**, and **not final**.

All contents — including code, documentation, structure, and mappings — are **provisional** and subject to change prior to formal doctoral submission.

---

## Relationship to the PhD Thesis

The doctoral thesis associated with this work is **still in preparation**.

- No version of this repository should be treated as the authoritative supplementary artefact.
- No claims in this repository should be cited as final research results.
- Structural, theoretical, and computational components may be revised, reorganised, or removed.

A **canonical supplementary artefact** (including a frozen repository state and formal citation details) will be created **only at the point of submission**.

---

## Intended Use at This Stage

At v0.1, this repository exists to:

- support **active research and experimentation**,
- maintain alignment between evolving theory, code, and documentation,
- enable internal sanity checks and diagnostics,
- explore post-submission architectural directions without freezing them.

It is **not** intended to:
- serve as a reference implementation,
- support production or operational use,
- define stable APIs or contracts,
- function as a final archival record.

---

## Documentation and Cross-References

Documents such as:
- README.md
- ROADMAP.md
- STRUCTURE.md
- thesis/crosswalk.md

should be read as **drafts**. Any mappings or claims they contain are **provisional** and may change prior to submission.

---

## Citation Guidance

Please **do not cite** this repository as a completed research artefact.

Formal citation information will be provided **only** with the canonical submission-time release.

---

## Future Canonicalisation

At doctoral submission, a specific tagged release or archive will be designated as:

- the **canonical supplementary artefact**, and
- the authoritative reference for thesis-aligned claims.

This file will be updated or replaced at that time to reflect the change in status.

## Summary

> **This repository is a living research workspace, not a finished scholarly record.**

Treat all contents accordingly.
