# ROADMAP.md  
## Scope, Freeze Point, and Post-Doctoral Trajectory

---

## Purpose of This Roadmap

This roadmap documents the **intentional scope, completion status, and freeze point** of this repository.

It exists to make explicit that this repository represents a **completed doctoral artefact**, not an ongoing software project, platform, or research programme. It also clarifies how future work may relate to—but is **not contained within**—this repository.

This file should be read alongside `README.md`, `CHARTER.md`, and `NON_CLAIMS.md`.

---

## Status of This Repository

**Status:** *Frozen at doctoral submission*  
**Intended canonical tag:** `v1.0-phd`

All materials in this repository correspond to the state of the work as submitted for PhD examination.

Until a **formal, tagged release** is made, the repository should be treated as **non-canonical** for citation and interpretive purposes. The canonical PhD artefact is the thesis manuscript together with the repository contents as they existed at submission.

After submission, commits are limited to:
- clerical or formatting corrections,
- repair of broken links or metadata,
- explicitly labelled interpretive aids.

No post-submission commit alters, extends, or reinterprets the theoretical claims of the doctoral work.

No new features, experiments, analyses, or implementations will be added here.

---

## What Is Complete

The following components are considered **complete and final** for the purposes of the PhD.

### 1. Thesis Materials
- Final doctoral manuscript
- Mathematical appendices
- Figures and tables
- Formal definitions and notation

These materials constitute the **authoritative statement** of the research claims.

---

### 2. Formal Theory
- Knowledge–Information Theory (K–IT)
- Hilbert Epistemic Field (HEF) formalism
- Definitions of entropy, coherence, potential, and stability
- Regime classification (informational, misinformational, disinformational)

Theoretical content is presented in mathematically explicit and human-readable form. No further formal extensions are implied.

---

### 3. Reference Implementation
- A minimal, readable implementation of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL)
- Code sufficient to witness operationalisation of the theory
- Emphasis on interpretability, traceability, and epistemic clarity over optimisation

The implementation is **illustrative and evidential**, not production-grade and not authoritative.

---

### 4. Empirical Traces
- Curated runs demonstrating epistemic regimes and instability patterns
- Frozen configurations, manifests, and outputs
- Trace artefacts sufficient to inspect claims without rerunning experiments

These traces serve as **evidence**, not benchmarks or performance evaluations.

---

### 5. Documentation and Diagrams
- System and pipeline diagrams
- Field and regime visualisations
- Conceptual governance and federation sketches

Documentation is intended to support scholarly understanding and auditability, not developer onboarding or system deployment.

---

## What Is Intentionally Excluded

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for this repository:

- Production deployment tooling
- Performance optimisation
- Scalability engineering
- Continuous integration beyond basic reproducibility
- Active maintenance or feature development
- User interfaces or dashboards
- Centralised services or platforms
- Fully implemented federation protocols
- Enforcement, alignment, or governance mechanisms

Their absence is intentional and load-bearing.

---

## Federation and Scale: Future Work (Non-Implemented)

The thesis discusses the *possibility* of future federated deployments and large-scale epistemic diagnostics. Within this repository, such ideas appear only as:

- conceptual documentation,
- illustrative sketches,
- and explicitly non-operational discussion.

No federation protocol, governance structure, economic model, or global system is initiated, defined, or hosted here.

Any such work, if pursued, will occur in **separate repositories and institutions** and must not be attributed retroactively to this artefact.

---

## Post-Doctoral Development Path (Informative Only)

After completion of the PhD, possible downstream directions include:

1. **Independent research repositories**
   - Extended or alternative formalisation
   - Comparative epistemic frameworks
   - Additional empirical studies

2. **Operational reference systems**
   - Federated HIL-style instances
   - Institutional diagnostic tooling
   - Clearly bounded, optional deployments

3. **Commercial or institutional derivatives**
   - Diagnostic instruments
   - Research infrastructure
   - Non-extractive, explicitly scoped applications

None of these paths modify, extend, or reinterpret the contents of this repository.

---

## How to Use This Repository

Readers should treat this repository as:

- a **static scholarly archive**,
- a **supporting evidential record** for the thesis,
- and a **reference object** for citation and inspection.

Those wishing to build on the work should do so by:
- forking or creating new repositories,
- citing the canonical PhD artefact,
- and clearly distinguishing derivative work from the doctoral submission.

---

## Final Statement

This roadmap exists to make one point unambiguous:

> **This repository is complete.**

Its purpose is to preserve coherence between theory, implementation, and evidence at the point of doctoral submission—not to evolve indefinitely.

Future work begins elsewhere.
