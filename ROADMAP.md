# ROADMAP.md  
## Scope, Freeze Point, and Post-Doctoral Trajectory

---

## Purpose of This Roadmap

This roadmap documents the **intentional scope, completion status, and freeze point** of this repository.

It exists to make explicit that this repository represents a **completed doctoral artefact**, not an ongoing software project or evolving platform. It also clarifies how future work relates to—but is not contained within—this repository.

This file should be read alongside `README.md` and `CHARTER.md`.

---

## Status of This Repository

**Status:** *Frozen at doctoral submission*  
**Canonical tag:** `v1.0-phd`

All materials in this repository correspond to the state of the work as submitted for PhD examination. Except for minor clerical corrections (e.g. typos, broken links), the contents are not expected to change.

No new features, experiments, or implementations will be added here after submission.

---

## What Is Complete

The following components are considered **complete and final** for the purposes of the PhD:

### 1. Thesis Materials
- Final doctoral manuscript
- Mathematical appendices
- Figures and tables
- Formal definitions and notation

These materials constitute the authoritative statement of the research claims.

---

### 2. Formal Theory
- Knowledge–Information Theory (K–IT) concepts
- Hilbert Epistemic Field (HEF) formalism
- Definitions of entropy, coherence, potential, and stability
- Regime classification (informational, misinformational, disinformational)

Theoretical content is documented in human-readable and mathematically explicit form.

---

### 3. Reference Implementation
- A minimal, readable implementation of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL)
- Code sufficient to demonstrate operationalisation of the theory
- Emphasis on interpretability and traceability over optimisation

The implementation is **illustrative and evidential**, not production-grade.

---

### 4. Empirical Traces
- Curated runs demonstrating epistemic regimes and instability patterns
- Frozen configurations, manifests, and outputs
- Trace artefacts sufficient to inspect claims without rerunning experiments

These traces serve as **evidence**, not benchmarks.

---

### 5. Documentation and Diagrams
- System and pipeline diagrams
- Field and regime visualisations
- Governance and federation sketches (conceptual, not operational)

Documentation is intended to support scholarly understanding rather than developer onboarding.

---

## What Is Intentionally Excluded

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for this repository:

- Production deployment tooling
- Performance optimisation
- Scalability engineering
- Continuous integration pipelines beyond basic reproducibility
- Active maintenance or feature development
- User interfaces or dashboards
- Centralised services or platforms
- Fully implemented federation protocols

Their absence is intentional and reflects the research nature of the artefact.

---

## Federation and Scale: Future Work (Non-Implemented)

The thesis discusses the possibility of future federated deployments and planetary-scale epistemic diagnostics. These ideas are represented here only as:

- conceptual documentation,
- minimal protocol sketches,
- and clearly marked non-goals.

Any operational federation, governance structure, or economic model will be developed in **separate repositories and institutions**.

This repository should not be interpreted as initiating or hosting such systems.

---

## Post-Doctoral Development Path (Informative Only)

After completion of the PhD, potential future work may include:

1. **Independent research repositories**
   - Extended formalisation
   - Comparative epistemic models
   - Additional empirical studies

2. **Operational reference systems**
   - Federated HIL instances
   - Institutional tooling
   - Governance-enforced deployments

3. **Commercial or institutional derivatives**
   - Diagnostic instruments
   - Advisory or research infrastructure
   - Non-extractive, bounded applications

None of these will modify the contents of this repository.

---

## How to Use This Repository

Readers are encouraged to treat this repository as:

- a **static scholarly archive**,
- a **reference point for citation**,
- and a **source of inspectable evidence** supporting the thesis.

Those wishing to build upon the work should do so by:
- forking the repository,
- citing the canonical version,
- and clearly distinguishing derivative work from the doctoral artefact.

---

## Final Statement

This roadmap exists to make one thing unambiguous:

> **This repository is complete.**

Its purpose is to preserve coherence between theory, implementation, and evidence at the point of doctoral submission, not to evolve indefinitely.

Future work begins elsewhere.
