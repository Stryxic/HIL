## Epistemic Scope, Boundaries, and Governance Principles

---

## Purpose of This Charter

This charter defines the **epistemic, technical, and normative boundaries** of the Hilbert Information Lab (HIL) as presented in this repository.

Its purpose is to ensure that the ideas, methods, and reference implementation contained here are:
- interpreted correctly,
- applied responsibly,
- and not repurposed in ways that contradict the core commitments of the doctoral research.

This charter is part of the scholarly record accompanying the PhD thesis  
**“Detecting Disinformation Campaigns in Social Media”** and should be read as a binding interpretive guide for this repository.

---

## What This Work Is

The work documented here constitutes:

- a **formal theoretical framework** for modelling informational structure and stability,
- a **computational epistemology** grounded in coherence, entropy, and field dynamics,
- and a **diagnostic research instrument** for detecting epistemic instability in complex information environments.

The central claim of the research is that disinformation, miscoordination, and epistemic collapse can be studied as **structural phenomena**, without recourse to truth arbitration, intent inference, or behavioural intervention.

---

## What This Work Is Not

To avoid misinterpretation, this work explicitly **is not**:

- a content moderation system,
- a fact-checking or truth-verification engine,
- a persuasion, nudging, or behaviour-change tool,
- a surveillance or monitoring platform,
- an enforcement, ranking, or scoring system for individuals or beliefs,
- a replacement for human judgement, governance, or deliberation.

Any use that frames the system as deciding *what is true*, *who is right*, or *how people should think or act* is outside the scope of this research and contradicts its foundational premises.

---

## Diagnostic-Only Commitment

All outputs produced by the methods and reference implementation in this repository are **diagnostic**.

They are intended to:
- characterise patterns of informational coherence and instability,
- identify regime-level behaviours (e.g. equilibrium, resonance, collapse),
- and support meta-level understanding of epistemic conditions.

They are **not** intended to:
- prescribe decisions,
- mandate interventions,
- justify enforcement actions,
- or substitute for contextual human reasoning.

The distinction between **diagnosis** and **prescription** is foundational and non-negotiable.

---

## Orthogonality to Markets, Politics, and Belief

The epistemic space modelled by this work is intentionally designed to be **orthogonal** to:
- market allocation,
- political authority,
- ideological alignment,
- and belief enforcement.

Orthogonality here means that:
- informational diagnostics do not translate directly into economic or political commands,
- movement within the epistemic model does not imply required action in lived systems,
- and no single axis (economic, political, epistemic) is permitted to dominate the others.

This separation is a core safety property of the framework.

---

## Data and Agency Boundaries

Consistent with its epistemic commitments, this work assumes:

- respect for local data sovereignty,
- minimal data retention by default,
- avoidance of centralised data aggregation,
- and clear separation between analytical structure and personal content.

The reference implementation is not designed to extract, monetise, or centralise user data, attention, or behavioural signals.

Any deployment that violates these assumptions departs from the intent of the research.

---

## Governance Orientation

Although this repository itself is a static scholarly artefact, the research anticipates future operational contexts.

Any future system derived from this work is expected to uphold the following governance principles:

- **Separation of economic and epistemic authority**  
  Financial contribution must not purchase interpretive or decisional power.

- **Custodial rather than proprietary control**  
  Authority exists to preserve boundaries, not to extract value.

- **Non-acquirability by capital alone**  
  The framework must not become coercible through ownership or scale.

- **Slow, explicit change**  
  Foundational changes require deliberation, transparency, and broad consent.

These principles are articulated here to prevent retroactive reinterpretation.

---

## Federation and Scale (Non-Goals)

While the thesis discusses the possibility of federated, decentralised deployments, this repository:

- does not implement a federation,
- does not define a global authority,
- does not establish a platform or network effect.

Any future federation must:
- preserve local autonomy,
- remain optional and revocable,
- and prioritise replication over centralisation.

Scaling the *ideas* does not imply scaling a single system or institution.

---

## Limits of Responsibility

The author provides this work as a scholarly contribution.

Responsibility for:
- deployment,
- interpretation in operational contexts,
- and downstream consequences

rests with those who choose to apply or extend the work.

This charter exists to make the original intent explicit, not to claim control over future use.

---

## Final Statement

This project is motivated by a single concern:

> **Preserving the human capacity to know in environments that systematically overwhelm it.**

It seeks to do so:
- without coercion,
- without centralised authority,
- and without substituting epistemic diagnosis for human judgement.

Any use that undermines these aims departs from the spirit and substance of the work documented here.
